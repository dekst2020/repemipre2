From the Disney armada to Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming, there&#x27;s something out there for everyone. Animation has transcended its former children-oriented niche. In fact, shows like The Simpsons and South Park are aimed directly at older audiences. There&#x27;s a cartoon out there for you, no matter what your taste. But what about the heritage of the se animated shows? What are the classics? We thought we&#x27;d chime in by listing off our favorite shows based on and inspired by comics and collectibles. If you&#x27;re looking for a more comprehensive look at animation, be sure to visit IGN&#x27;s TV channel. They have already published one feature looking at the best of prime time animation (which can be viewed by clicking here ) and are bound to do more. Also, for you anime fans, we will cover the best manga-to-anime conversions in a future feature. <p> In generating our rosters, we considered a variety of factors. With shows based on comics, we looked at how closely the source material was followed. Were stories followed precisely? Was the spirit of the comic book intact? We also considered complexity and the range of appeal. Some shows are simply geared towards a wider audience. We also considered the impact of the show on the American culture as well as our own personal nostalgia for that series (basically consider that a reviewer&#x27;s tilt of sorts). Finally, we gauged how much fun we had watching the show. As always, feel free to e-mail us with your thoughts. You can access our e-mail form by clicking here .</p> <p> </p> <p> <strong> Shows Inspired By The Comics/Collectibles Genre</strong> <p> </p> </p> While working on this article, we decided to split it into two categories. The first lists shows inspired by comics or collectibles. Clearly there are many shows in this field, but we narrowed it down to five. We tried to keep our selections as close to comics and adventure as we could, and chose to eliminate many animated series that had simply generated books. Virtually every cartoon has had a comic book at some point, so we had to do something to contain that. Narrowing the list was difficult, but here are five classics no one should miss. <p> </p> <p> <strong> <p> Rank</p> </strong> <strong> <p> Series</p> </strong> <strong> <p> Why We Love This Show</p> </strong> <strong> <p> 5</p> </strong> <strong> <p> <br/> G.I. Joe</p> </strong> Any child growing up in the&#x27;80s has to be aware of this show. Together with Transformers, the G.I. Joe property created a commercial sensation. Amazingly enough, this phenomenon has been recently revived. A Transformers film is due this summer and G.I. Joe has multiple successful toy and comic book lines running simultaneously. Additionally, rumors of a G.I. Joe movie are always swirling around in Hollywood. <p> So why did we elect G.I. Joe to our list instead of Transformers? Ultimately it comes down to a couple factors, one being that G.I. Joe was the first to hit the animation market. Both products were a part of Hasbro&#x27;s toy line and both were brought to animation studios as well as Marvel Comics to be expanded into major commercial juggernauts. G.I. Joe was the first and due to its success, Transformers was brought into the fray. Our choice is also due to our personal affinity for the series. As much as we like robots, there was something about a special ops team fighting a legion of crazed enemies that won our hearts. That and Cobra Commander. Despite his goofy nature, you can&#x27;t help but root for the faceless tyrant. We detect hate mail coming our way for this choice…</p> <strong> <p> 4</p> </strong> <strong> <p> <br/> Venture Bros</p> </strong> Any genre that has the luxury of being imitated or derived for a comedy has earned a special place in pop culture. In this case, Venture Bros is the charming imitator. Deriving its feel from classic shows such as Johnny Quest , this group of adventurers continuously references comic book archetypes. When there&#x27;s an organization called The Guild of Calamitous Intent … comics have definitely had an influence. As the show progresses, references to Spider-Man , Batman , Black Widow, James Bond, Doctor Doom, Nick Fury and many more show up repeatedly. If there&#x27;s any show that spins its world from the comic book culture more, we&#x27;d like to see it. <strong> <p> 3</p> </strong> <strong> <p> <br/> Gargoyles</p> </strong> This might seem like an add choice, but we think there&#x27;s a huge comic book element to this series. A decidedly mature cartoon series, Gargoyles follows the adventures and trials of a group of, well, gargoyles trapped in New York (pretty self-explanatory we think). The series wove its drama through complex issues and arcs, which was rare for cartoons back then. While some youthful series (see next entry) were better at adventures, Gargoyles was forging a fairly unique and original path. Its dedicated fan base has managed to keep the property afloat - though the cartoon last aired in 1997, comics continue to be published to this day. <strong> <p> 2</p> </strong> <strong> <p> <br/> Duck Tales</p> </strong> Life is like a hurricane, here in Duckburg. Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes - it&#x27;s a duck blur. You might solve a mystery, or rewrite history. Duck Tales - Woo-ooo! Sorry, we had to do that. Maybe it&#x27;s just the people we know, but whenever you start to chant the catchy lyrics to this show, everyone around you immediately chants in with the Duck Tales - Woo-ooo! portion of the theme song. If that&#x27;s not a sign of success and cultural impact, we don&#x27;t know what is.<p> Duck Tales is somewhat unique in that it could really be placed in either of our categories. Though the show spawned its own comic book series, it is in turn inspired and derived from the classic Uncle Scrooge comics. Scrooge, uncle of the famous Donald Duck, looks after his grand-nephews and steers them clear of danger (or the reverse in many cases) as he searches for treasures across the world. Most of the plots in the series are variations on the treasure-hunting theme, but we have to be honest - these shows are just as fun now, nearly 20 years later, as they were when they originally aired. </p> <strong> <p> 1</p> </strong> <strong> <p> <br/> The Incredibles</p> </strong> When we first saw an ad for Brad Bird&#x27;s The Incredibles we weren&#x27;t sure what to expect. Would the Pixar film merely be a spoof of the comic book industry? Would it try to be a serious, character-driven film? Would it appeal to older audiences? The answers, fortunately, turned out to be yes in all cases. <p> Incredibles was not just humorous, it managed to appeal to viewers of all ages with its emotional family drama. Anyone could identify with at least one of the characters be it Mr. Incredible himself or the hyperactive Dash. Though the villain was a bit of a goof ball, we found his wicked robot provided plenty of action for our super hero crew. And who can forget the ever-lovable Edna E Mode? </p> <p> Though Incredibles was an entirely original property, it felt like it had grown up with the rest of the comic book industry. While still managing a very amusing and moving plot, Incredibles still paid tribute to everything that had come before it. Well done, Pixar, well done.</p> Click here to see our Top Comic-Based Shows </p> <h3> In This Article</h3> <h1> Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker </h1> <span> Summary :</span> <span> N/A</span> <span> Genres :</span> Superhero, Animation, Adventure, Action <span> Platforms :</span> DVD, On-Demand, Blu-ray <span> Producers :</span> <span> N/A</span> <span> Distributors :</span> Warner Home Video <span> Release Date :</span> December 12, 2000 <span> </span> <span> <h3> <span> The Most Messed Up Moments in the Comic Book Version of ‘The Boys’</span> </h3> </span> <span> </span> <span> <h3> <span> The Best Anime Fanfiction Where the Hero Is a Villain</span> </h3> </span> Presented by Cheez-It Grooves <h3> How Does Halo 4&#x27;s Campaign Rank in the Series? - Never Played...
