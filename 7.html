The world of comics, cartoons , and anime culture is hugely popular and always evolving. For example, rather than requiring a physical comic book in your hand, comics are now available digitally instead, and some folk enjoys building their electronic collections. This means that the use of comic reader apps has grown, and there are also other apps that will help you to create your own impressive comic works or stream anime online.<span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </p> <span> </span> <span> </span> <p> The portability of Android devices means you can now have this whole arena at your fingertips, and it’s a great way of having instant access to tens of thousands of offerings as well as keeping in touch with all the latest. The Google Play Store is awash with comic and animation apps so if this subject is something that interests you there are many apps that you will get a lot of pleasure from. However, like most topics, there’s a fair share of these apps that are not so good and worth avoiding.</p> <p> Because of this, we’ve done the legwork and have put together our choice of the 10 best comic and anime apps for Android. Most of these recommended apps are free to download and use although some contain in-app purchases for additional features and more. Some of the free apps also offer a premium version as a trial period, after which you can choose whether to upgrade or not.<span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> </p> <p> These comic and anime apps cover a wide range, so whatever your specific interest you should find at least one or two that will be excellent options for you.</p> <h3> 10 best comic book readers for Android</h3> <h3> 1.
