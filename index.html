						<span> </span> <h1> What is the difference between a Comic, Cartoon, Manga and Anime?</h1> <span> <span> Michael Batko </span> <span> Follow </span> </span> <span> <span> Sep 25, 2017 · 1 min read </span> </span> <span> </span> <p> We all know that all 4 categories differ. But what is the difference?</p> <p> The simple way to explain this (there is lots of other definitions) is that <strong> Comic</strong> and <strong> Cartoon</strong> in the Western World is the same as <strong> Manga</strong> and <strong> Anime</strong> in Japan. <strong> Comic</strong> and <strong> Manga</strong> refer to the medium of illustrated stories on physical pages, whereas <strong> Cartoon</strong> and <strong> Anime</strong> refer to illustrated stories on TV ( Source ).</p> <p> Whilst both are caricatures and drawn by artists they are different in a number of aspects. The general rule of thumb is that <strong> Anime</strong> is closer to reality, as the characters have more distinct features and movement. <strong> Cartoon</strong> on the other hand is often two-dimensional and is typically non-realistic and simplifying intended for satire ( Source ).</p> <h2> MBWhatsThat</h2> <h4> Random unanswered questions and mysteries going through my…</h4> <span> Follow </span> <span> </span> <h4> 5 </h4> <span> </span> Anime Manga Curiosities Research Cartoon <span> <span> </span> <h4> 5<span>   claps</span> <span> </span> </h4> </span> <span> <span> </span> <h4> 5<span>   claps</span> <span> </span> </h4> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> <span> <p> Written by</p> <h2> Michael Batko </h2> <span> Follow </span> </span> </span> <h4> Learning Enthusiast</h4> <span> Follow </span> <span> <span> <h2> MBWhatsThat </h2> <span> Follow </span> </span> </span> <h4> Random unanswered questions and mysteries going through my head, which need answering</h4> <span> Follow </span> <p> Written by</p> <h2> Michael Batko </h2> <span> Follow </span> <h4> Learning Enthusiast</h4> <h2> MBWhatsThat </h2> <span> Follow </span> <h4> Random unanswered questions and mysteries going through my head, which need answering</h4> <h2> More From Medium</h2> <h2> Long-term trends in blockchain game pre-sales and NFT auctions </h2> <span> <span> DappRadar <span> in DappRadar.com </span> </span> </span> <h2> The Long Dark: A Beautifully Terrifying Survival Experience </h2> <span> <span> Michael Punzi </span> </span> <h2> The First Hash Rush Team Meetup </h2> <span> <span> Hash Rush <span> in VZ Games </span> </span> </span> <h2> 28 Blockchain games to keep an eye on in 2020 </h2> <span> <span> Robert Hoogendoorn <span> in The Startup </span> </span> </span> <h2> What Hollow Knight’s Creators Can Teach You About Creativity </h2> <span> <span> Balloon Monsoon </span> </span> <h2> Social Gaming and The Future of VR </h2> <span> <span> Richard Yao <span> in IPG Media Lab </span> </span> </span> <h2> Reading Junji Ito’s ‘Army of One’ in the Age of Isolation </h2> <span> <span> Lauren Entwistle <span> in Curious </span> </span> </span> <h2> How can Enjin make Diablo 4 into possibly one of the best games to ever exist </h2> <span> <span> Arturas Rizen </span> </span> <h2> Learn more.</h2> <h4> Medium is an open platform where 170 million readers come to find insightful and dynamic thinking.
